## Hello, world! 👋🏻

I am Lucas, a Software Engineer with over 5 years of experience with a special focus on Ruby on Rails and SaaS products. I have worked in several industries, including fintech, insurance, and online subscription management platform. 

The Ruby language and the Rails framework were technologies I chose after I started programming, and I'm still **excited** to work with them every day. ❤️

I've been **learning in public** on <a href="https://jaggies-weekly.netlify.app/">my blog</a> and sharing my two cents on <a href="https://ruby.social/@jaggiesweekly">Mastodon</a>, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jaggiesweekly.bsky.social‬">BlueSky</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lsfernandes92">LinkedIn</a>.
