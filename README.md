### Hi, I'm Lucas 👋🏻🧑🏼‍💻

I'm a software engineer who graduated in Computer Information Systems from São Paulo, Brazil. I consider myself a padawan with a passion for coding. Currently, I am on the lookout for an exciting opportunity where I can unleash my coding skills and connect with like-minded individuals. Some technologies I enjoy working with include Ruby on Rails, RSpec, and API development. Currently, I am enhancing my skills through personal projects, engaging in code challenges, and delving into technical books.
